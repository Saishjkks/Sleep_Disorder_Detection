# üò¥ Sleep Disorder Detection  

## üìñ Project Overview  
The **Sleep Disorder Detection System** is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of sleep disorders based on health and lifestyle parameters.  
The project leverages various classification algorithms (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost, and Stacking Classifier) and is implemented as a **Django web application** with a user-friendly frontend.
