Sleep Disorder Detection
Project Overview

The Sleep Disorder Detection system is a machine learning-based application designed to predict sleep disorders based on various health and lifestyle parameters. The project utilizes the Decision Tree algorithm and is implemented as a Flask and Django web application.
Features
1.Predicts the likelihood of sleep disorders based on user input.
2.User-friendly web interface built using Flask and Django.
3.Utilizes the Decision Tree algorithm for classification.

Supports input features like:
1.Gender
2.Age
3.Occupation
4.Sleep Duration
5.Quality of Sleep
6.Physical Activity Level
7.Stress Level
8.BMI Category
9.Heart Rate
10.Daily Steps
11.Systolic & Diastolic Blood Pressure
